Still very new to night photography.

Thanks to Casey and Philip the organizers.

This last one was an accidental (yet retrospectively happy) double exposure.

The color is Cinestill 800T in 6x6, which I metered largely by guess with some estimation help from my cheapo usb meter.  Although I only liked the composition of a few, most came out properly exposed.

The black and white shots I took in 35mm with a 35mm lens mostly wide open and at around 1/125 without adjusting (more than maybe a stop) for the actual lighting.  I did this as an experiment, since I had heard that <nuxt-link to="/posts/diy-rodinal-film-developer-experiment">Rodinal stand development</nuxt-link> could compensate for a wide range of ISO ratings on the same roll: if overexposed, hopefully HP5's latitude would save it, if underexposed, the Rodinal could push it.  I think the results came out decently.
