This camera originally belonged to my aunt's first husband, then to my aunt herself, who eventually gave it to my mother, who eventually replaced it with the <nuxt-link to="moms-canon-camera">Canon EOS Rebel S</nuxt-link>.  Most of the early childhood photos of me were taken with this camera.  I think my mother gave it to me sometime in the late 90s or early 2000s, but I don't recall exactly.

During the early days of the pandemic, I was restlessly perambulating in my apartment between meetings, looking for something fun and tactile to fidget with during my next meeting.  I ran across this, and for a week it was my new fidget item.

Then I started wondering if it still worked.  So I ordered a roll of film.  

It worked.  Then I got the film back and was hooked.  I don't know why, but I'd expected some crappy grainy trash.  Probably because, my high school newspaper had lower standards (and a lower budget).  We've come a long way.

After a few rolls though, I noticed that many of my pictures had odd focus issues and a few had light leaks.  Inspecting the camera, I realized the front bezel where the lens mounts was a little loose, so I had the excellent folks at <a href="https://www.seawood.com/">Seawood Photo</a> repair it.  

Excited to have it back now that I know a little bit more about what I'm doing.
