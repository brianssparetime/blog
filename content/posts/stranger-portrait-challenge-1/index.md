As an exercise in pushing my limits and doing something different, I decided to shoot an entire roll of Delta 100 (6x6) where each and every frame would be a portrait of a stranger I approached and asked to photograph.

Roughly 60% of the folks I approached agreed, and the results are below with minimal editing.

I did double-wind one frame between walks, so there are only 11 shots.  Moreover, although I've gotten decent at correcting for parallax on my <nuxt-link to="/posts/canon-L1-review">Canon L1</nuxt-link>, I completely forgot to do it in this session with the <nuxt-link to="/posts/moskva5-review/">Moskva 5</nuxt-link> since I almost always shoot it either at infinity or at a hyperfocal distance with a huge depth of field.  As a result, the composition of a few of these is terrible, with areas visible to me in the viewfinder on the top and right not captured on the film, resulting in uncomfortably little headroom.

That said, I'm quite pleased with a few, and by the ratio of those to the number of frames shot, this roll was an unqualified success to me.

In the order I shot them:
