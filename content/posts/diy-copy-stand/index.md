My <nuxt-link to="/posts/first-time-film-scanning">initial home scanning set up</nuxt-link> was janky and finnicky and consumed too much space.

This is less janky, much smaller, easier not to bump into, but still quite finnicky to adjust.  Made with 3/4" SteelTek pipe fittings from Lowe's and some 3/4" playwood I had around.  Total cost under $50.

I likely need to replace the SteelTek flange attached to the base with a screw-mount because there is way too much play in it.  Or maybe I'll just JB weld it in place....
