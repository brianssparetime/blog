This was the first "real" camera I owned, bought I think as a Christmas present from my parents (thank you!), maybe around 1993-94?  

I remember wanting something mostly automatic, but I think I chose this one because it had extra focus buttons, though I'm not sure that was a wise decision.  I still don't know exactly how those buttons work, and a lot of shots seemed out of focus.

That said, especially in black and white, this camera can also take some amazing pictures.  And the portability/convenience is still as good as it was in the 90s.
