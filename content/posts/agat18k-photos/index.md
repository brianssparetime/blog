The Agat 18K is a Soviet lightweight semi-manual half frame viewfinder camera.  It is lightweight yet rugged, cheap in both price and feel, plastic, simple, and ugly.  The controls are annoyingly stiff, the shutter button has zero tactile feedback and frequently sticks.  

But it's supremely portable, reliable, and takes fantastic photos.  I love it.

The focus distance is set on the lens, and is easily reached by the same finger that you use for the shutter button.

The exposure is controlled by a ring around the lens, which is annoyingly sticky and difficult to set precisely, according to little icons indicating the lighting.  The ring controls both shutter speed and aperture together according to a set formula, in conjunction with the ISO that is dialed in below (the 18K model goes up to 1600 ISO).  On the rare occasions I change ISO, I need a pen or other sharp implement.

Although I prefer full manual control over aperture and shutter speed, the combination of zone focus and pictogram exposure provides me what I want:  the obligation to think explicitly about focus and exposure, yet the ability to intentionally pre-set for capturing quick action.

The film is advanced by the dial on the side.  It takes 2-3 smaller turns to wind to the next frame, with a very satifying resistance and release right at the end as the shutter cocks.  What the shutter button lacks in tactile feedback, the advance knob has.  On the other hand, the rewind makes my fingers bleed.

The viewfinder shows parallax correction lines, but no other information.

I find it one of the easiest cameras I own to load, and with almost no film wasted.  Inserting the cannister, the tiny amount of leader that sticks out by default is just the right amount to catch in the takeup spool, without needing to pull any more out.  This yields about 75-76 frames per 36 exposure roll.

After trying a half dozen half frame cameras (including the Konica Eye and Eye 2, Fujica Half, Chaika 3, and Canon Dial 35-2), the Agat 18k is the one I'll be keeping.  For all the poor build quality, it's a perfect camera to carry around in a pocket.  It's light, easily replaceable, and fun to use.


There is a small cover on the corner for a flash hotshoe, which I have never used.
